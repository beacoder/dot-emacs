* Register

** Hotkeys
   Note: R stands for your register name.
   <C-x r SPC R>  <C-x r s R>  <C-x r n R>  <C-x r w R>  <C-x r r R>  => save to register
   <C-x r i R>    <C-x r j R>                                         => insert or jump to register

   <C-SPC C-SPC>  => save cursor position
   <C-u C-SPC>    => jump back last saved cursor position
   <C-x C-SPC>    => jump to last position of the global mark ring

* Keyboard macro
  record a sequence of editing commands so that you can repeat it conveniently later.
** Hotkeys
   <C-x (>  do-some-stuff  <C-x )>  => define macro
   <C-x eeee...>                    => execute macro n times
** Command
   <name-last-kbd-macro>  <insert-kbd-macro>

* Undo & Redo
  undo or redo previous changes.
** Hotkeys
   <C-_>      => undo
   <C-g C-_>  => redo

* Recursive edit
  recursive-edit helps when you wanna break out of the command that youâ€™re executing and temporarily pursue something else.
  and then go back to where you were before.

** Sample:
   suppose you're in the middle of query-replace:
   <C-w> or <C-r>  => break out of query-replace, then do something else
   <C-M-c>         => go back to query-replace

* FAQ
** Deal with ispell error "no word lists can be found for the language "zh_cn"."
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
** Retrieve list of available packages from the package archive server.
